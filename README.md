# TL-Dashboard

This is an example project I had made on my spare time to help me automate some of my weekly duties. The project is not finished but it serves as a good proof of concept.

##Technologies

I'm using Python 3 with Flask as the backend, Firestore in Native mode as the Database and Vue.Js as the frontend.
Vue.Js communicates with the backend with a set of REST APIs.
I had added Google Oauth sign in, Flask Login-Manager and it can communicate with Google Drive, Google Sheets and AppScript.
